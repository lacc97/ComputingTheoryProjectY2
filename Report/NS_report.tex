{\Large \textbf{Abstract}}~\\[0.3cm]
In this project, the effects of the internal structure of the neutron stars on their maximum radius and mass were examined by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation with appropriate equation of states using 4th order Runge-Kutta method. For the equation of state, pure Fermi gas consisting of proton and neutron was used, and different strength of nuclear interactions were considered by varying the nuclear incompressibility. [Results comes here].
